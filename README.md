# flare-bindings

Pre-built bindings for various web3 contracts available on the Flare Networks blockchain.

This repo currently contains bindings / wrappers for golang, there is also a Java wrapper 
for the WNat contract available in this github (github.com/xrpdevs)

At some point I will build the java wrappers for all the same contracts as are currently
present for golang and include them in this repository.

Hope these help somebody.
